# :beetle: Test failure
> Test failures can be caused by incorrect output formatting, logic errors, or runtime errors. They are more difficult to find and fix than syntax/style errors. But if you follow the directions in each section below, you should be able to pinpoint the bug. (Syntax errors will cause the tests to fail, too, but you should catch those before you send your project here!) Once you think you've found the issue, update your program and resubmit (commit/push). You may need to repeat this cycle several times. :repeat:

### :printer: Output formatting
1. Open the [assignment directions](/README.md) here in GitHub, and note the **expected output**.
2. Run your program with the sample input provided.
3. Compare the format of your console output to the output format required in the directions. 
4. Do they match **EXACTLY**? The capitalization, punctuation, whitespace, and formatting must match exactly.
### :arrow_forward: Manually run the ALL test cases
1. Look at the error messages below. Can you tell what tests failed?
2. Manually run your program using those test cases to see what happened and try to resolve the issue.
3. Consider "edge" cases - places where the behavior of a program shifts - and try those.
### :mag_right: Re-read the directions
- Open the [assignment directions](../blob/main/README.md) and re-read them very closely several times. Did you miss any small details?
### :footprints: Step through your program with Pythontutor
- Copy your code, paste it into the [this text box](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit), then click **Visualize Execution**.
- Step through execution of each line of code by pressing the **next** button beneath your code.
- Watch exactly what is happening in memory at each step. This will allow you quickly identify and fix logic errors.
### :writing_hand: Re-write your algorithm from scratch
- Don't start with the code, start with your algorithm.

### ðŸ‘‹ Ask for help!
- Check with your friend or neighbor. Helping others find errors is great practice.
- Did you stump your neighbor? Ask Megan! ðŸ˜Š
